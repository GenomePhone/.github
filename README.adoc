== Overview

Variant calling is a process in bioinformatics that identifies differences in a genomic sequence compared to a reference sequence. These differences, or variants, can include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and others. Variant calling plays a crucial role in understanding the genetic basis of diseases, among other applications.

GenomePhone is a framework for distributed variant calling.
